SARS-Cov-2 (Active/Inactive) Inhibitors Classification:

1. Raw data are taken from the ChEMBL database and stored in SarsCov2.csv
2. Processed data (cleaned and generated molecular descriptors) are store in SarsCoV2_descriptors
3. Codes are in the Jupyter notebook Assignment1_SarsCoV2.ipynb

ESol (solubility/insolubility) classification:

1. Raw data are taken from MoleculeNet and stored in esol.csv
2. Processed data (cleaned and generated molecular descriptors) are stored in Esol_descriptors.csv
3. Codes are in the Jupyter notebook Assignment1_esol.ipynb

The second feature type (Morgan fingerprints) can be generated within the Jupyter notebooks using RDKit.
References of original papers are cited within the analysis.
